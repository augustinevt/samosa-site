    <p class="body">Why do I think it matters? It's weird the dog's been alive for three years and all this time it's gone by this name that seems to mean nothing when his <em>dame</em> was named thing for bling and <em>sire</em> Wind Danger Jenstar Backstage Pass so where does the dog even begin to understand a name with its repetition and its combination with all those commands requests squeals of joy silly voices fits of scratching with those oh so familiar tones rhythms coming random and without the chance of ever repeating it you stare on in puzzlement trying to understand the most basic thing, except you don't you're a dog suspended by images and memory and all these voices and rhythms massage your mind and when these things mean any interest you find yourself getting excited at the sound of it. Yes. Whatever it is I'm coming!</p>
